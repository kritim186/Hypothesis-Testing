Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data.
It involves formulating a hypothesis, collecting data, and then using statistical techniques to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the hypothesis or not.

Formulate Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H₀): This is the hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference, and it represents a statement of no change or status quo.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha): This is the hypothesis that there is an effect or a difference, and it represents what you aim to support.
